# Overview

Polyhedra is a tool to help you write programs that manage dice using
the kinds of expressions most RPG rulebooks use. Some examples of dice
expressions that can be handled:

* d20
* 3d6
* 6d6
* 1d4-1
* 2d6x10
* 2d6*10
* 4d6t3     # roll 4d6, take highest 3
* 3d6r2     # roll 3d6, re-rolling 1's or 2's
* 2d6-1x10  # note that +/- modifiers happen before multipliers; that's just how dice math works. 2d6-1x10 == 1-11x10 == 10-110
* 1d6 fire  # you can assign units to the dice as well

Polyhedra understands dice math:

* 3d6 + 2d6 => 5d6
* 2d6 + 1d4 => 2d6 + 1d4 # dissimilar bases can't be added
* 1d6 fire + 1d4 fire + 1d6 earth => 1d6 + 1d4 fire + 1d6 earth # similar units are grouped before bases

Note that adding two dissimilar dice results in a "DiceSet", which is
a collection of Dice objects. You can still "roll" a DiceSet just like
you would a Dice object, but #sides won't work and #units will return
an array.

Polyhedra also understands units, and knows to avoid adding dice of
different units:

* 3d6 fire + 2d6 physical
* 1d4 frost + 2

# Dice Notation

The simplest RPG Dice notation is given as numbers and letters of the
form _NdS_, where N is the number of dice to roll and S is the number
of sides per die. When you roll all the dice in a Yahtzee cup, you are
rolling 5d6, or five dice, each with six sides. If you are rolling a
single die, you can omit the 1 and represent the notation as e.g d6.

Role-playing games make allowances for other alterations to the roll:
you can add or subtract (2d6+3, 1d4-1), multiply or divide (1d4x10,
1d6/2). (Note that most game systems round down, so 1d6/2 actually
yields a number between 0 and 3.)

Mathematically, none of the following are equivalent: 1d3, 1d4-1,
1d6/2. The first one cannot roll 0's, and although the second two have
the same min/max range, 1d4-1 has an even distribution--exactly a 25%
chance of rolling each number--while 1d6/2 has an uneven distribution
(a 17% chance of rolling a 0, 33% chance of rolling a 1, etc).

## Notational Affixes

* rR - Reroll any dice equal or below R. R must be < S. 3d6r3 will
  roll 12-18 as each die must be 4 or higher to be kept.
  Mathematically 3d6r3 is identical to 3d3+9 but the semantics are
  considered to be different so the extra notation is allowed.

* RR - Reroll any dice equal or above R. R must be > 1 and <= S.

* kM - Keep highest M dice. 1 < M < N. 4d6k3 means roll 4d6, but only
  count the highest 3 dice in the final tally.

* KM - Keep lowest M dice. 1 < M < N.



# Order of Operations

Rerolls are considered first, then keeps. Next--and this is the
reverse of typical algebraic precedence--addition or subtraction
happens and finally multiplication or division. Thus

  4d6r1k3+1x10

Would roll dice until 4 dice showed 2 or higher, then the top 3 dice
would be kept. The range at this point would be 6-18. 1 would be added
to this bumping the range to 7-19. Finally the roll is mulitplied by
10 to yield a range of 70-190. Note that because multiplication is
performed last the final value will be in steps of the multiplier;
e.g. the above dice expression could roll a 70, 80, 90, etc., but
could not roll a 75 or an 81.

# Monkeypatch! Woo! (Fixnum shorthand)

Polyhedra will add .d* methods to Fixnum and to Kernel (d20 is the same
as 1.d20 is the same as Dice.new "1d20"). Since this is a monkeypatch,
it's optional. Require polyhedra/shorthand instead of polyhedra to get
these methods.


    require 'polyhedra/shorthand'
    dice = 3.d6
    # => <#Dice: 3d6>

    fire1 = 1.d6("fire")
    fire2 = 2.d8("fire")
    fire3 = 3.d6(:fire) # symbols and strings are okay
    frost = 2.d6("frost")

    fire1 + fire2 + fire3 + frost
    # => <DiceSet: <Dice: 4d6, fire>, <Dice: 2d8, fire>, <Dice: 2d6 frost>]

Note that while the shorthand allows for modifiers like -1 or x10, it
looks kind of lame.

    1.d6("r1-1")
    # => <Dice: 1d6r1-1>
    2.d10("+3x10")
    # => <Dice: 2d10+3x10>
    d20
    # => <Dice: 1d20>

I am open to changing the interface to cascade like so:

4.d6.r1.k3("+1x10") but honestly this still looks unnecessarily
complicated. Better to just use Dice.new() at this point.

Then again, since we have to catch method_missing to allow for
arbitrary digits, maybe we could steal a page from the Rails playbook
and allow longer methods names that encode the entire sequence, such
as:

    4.d6r1t3
    # => <Dice: 4d6r1t3

The only gotcha is that we can't capture +/- in its proper place
(immediately after the dX sequence). Legal ruby would be `4.d6r1t3+3`
but proper dice notation would `4.d6+3r1t3` which won't work.

Hrm, if a Dice.new() or Fixnum#dXX statement returns a Dice object,
maybe we should define +,-,*,/ etc to return new Dice objects?

    d6
    # => <Dice: 1d6>
    d6 + 1
    # => <Dice: 1d6+1>


## Complex Notation

A set of Dice can be collected into a DiceSet and rolled as a unit:

    bag = DiceSet.new
    bag << Dice.new('3d6')
    bag << '2d4'  # bag#<< accepts Dice or string
    bag
    # => <DiceSet: <Dice: 3d6>, <Dice: 2d4>>
    bag.roll
    # => 19
    bag.max
    # => 26
    bag.min
    # => 5

## Units

Each Dice object can have its own units, and units are treated as a
higher-order grouping than number of sides. Note that #min, #max and #roll will
return an array of pairs containing the amount and unit for each type of dice.

    bag = DiceSet.new
    bag << 1.d6("fire")
    bag << 1.d6("fire")
    bag << 1.d4("frost")
    bag.min
    # => [[2, :fire], [1, :frost]]
    bag.min_without_units
    # => 3
    bag.max
    # => [[12, :fire], [4, :frost]]
    bag.max_without_units
    # => 16
    bag.roll
    # => [[7, :fire], [2, :frost]]
    bag.roll_without_units
    # => 11

You can also pass a specific unit to #min, #max and #roll to isolate
part of the roll:

    bag.max(:fire)
    # => 12
    bag.min(:frost)
    # => 1
    bag.roll(:fire)
    # => 3
